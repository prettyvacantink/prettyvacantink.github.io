            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I'm a Manchester based Tattoo Artist specialising in black work. Based in a private studio just a short walk from Deansgate Metrolink and Oxford Road train stations.</p>
            <p>My artwork and designs are not your typical pocket watch and roses. I take inspiration from artists such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/steadmanart/">Ralph Steadman</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamrichesart/">Adam Riches</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anthony_rondinone/">Anthony Rondinone</a>.</p>
